# WalletConnect SSR Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was encountering `ReferenceError: indexedDB is not defined` errors during server-side rendering (SSR) because WalletConnect was trying to access browser-only APIs like `indexedDB` on the server side.

## Root Cause
- WalletConnect library requires browser APIs (indexedDB, localStorage, etc.) that are not available during SSR
- Next.js tries to pre-render pages on the server, causing these APIs to be accessed before the client hydrates
- Multiple WalletConnect core initializations were occurring due to the provider setup

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Polyfills for SSR (`lib/polyfills.ts`)
Created polyfills for browser-only APIs that are needed during SSR:
- `indexedDB` mock with basic structure
- `IDBKeyRange` mock
- `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` mocks

### 2. Wagmi Configuration (`lib/wagmi.ts`)
- Import polyfills before other modules
- Maintain `ssr: true` configuration for proper SSR support
- Keep the QueryClient singleton pattern to prevent multiple initializations

### 3. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- Added webpack fallback configuration to handle indexedDB references
- Configured to mock indexeddb for server-side builds

### 4. Provider Optimization (`providers/wagmi-provider.tsx`)
- Created QueryClient singleton outside component to prevent multiple initializations
- Added proper client-side configuration

## Results
- ✅ Build process completes successfully without errors
- ✅ Development server starts without indexedDB errors
- ✅ SSR compatibility maintained
- ✅ Multiple initialization issues resolved
- ✅ Wallet functionality preserved

## Key Files Modified
1. `lib/polyfills.ts` - New polyfill file
2. `lib/wagmi.ts` - Added polyfill import
3. `next.config.ts` - Added webpack configuration
4. `providers/wagmi-provider.tsx` - Optimized provider setup

## Testing
- Build: `npm run build` ✅ Success
- Development: `npm run dev` ✅ Success
- No more indexedDB errors in console
- Wallet connection functionality preserved
