- Emergency stop enforcement
- Privilege escalation prevention

### 5. FlashLoanExecutorEdgeCases.t.sol
**Purpose**: Edge cases and boundary condition testing
**Coverage**:
- Maximum values (strategies, actions, BPS values)
- Zero values (profit, gas price, amounts)
- Empty arrays
- Contract interactions
- Large data payloads
- Extreme timestamps

**Key Edge Cases**:
- Maximum number of strategy actions (50)
- Maximum BPS values (10000)
- Zero profit strategies
- Empty asset arrays
- Self-referential targets

### 6. FlashLoanIntegrationTest.t.sol
**Purpose**: Integration tests with real testnet contracts (existing)
**Coverage**:
- Real Aave V3 integration
- Real DEX integration
- End-to-end strategy execution

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Failing Tests Explanation:
1. **Mock Tests**: Some failures due to complex execution flow mocking
2. **Fuzz Tests**: Edge cases with extremely large values
3. **Edge Cases**: Array bounds and gas price edge cases
4. **Security Tests**: Mock contract interaction issues

### Improvements Needed:
1. Better mock contract implementations
2. More robust edge case handling
3. Integration test refinements
4. Additional security test scenarios

## Test Coverage Areas

### ✅ Well Covered:
- Constructor validation
- Access control
- Strategy creation
- Admin functions
- View functions
- Emergency functions
- Basic security
- Fuzz testing for valid ranges

### ⚠️ Partially Covered:
- Complex execution flows
- Flash loan integration
- DEX interactions
- Profit calculations
- Error handling

### ❌ Needs More Coverage:
- Complex strategy execution
- Multi-token flash loans
- Cross-DEX arbitrage
- Real integration scenarios

## Contributing to Tests

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Add appropriate documentation
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
5. Add appropriate mocking where needed
6. Ensure tests are deterministic

## Mock Contracts

The test suite includes several mock contracts:
- **MockAavePool**: Simulates Aave flash loan functionality
- **MockERC20**: Basic ERC20 token for testing
- **MockDEXRouter**: Simulates DEX swap functionality
- **MockAddressProvider**: Provides mock addresses
- **ReentrancyAttacker**: Tests reentrancy protection

## Security Testing Focus

The security tests specifically target:
- Access control bypasses
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Flash loan attack vectors
- Emergency function abuse
- Input validation bypasses
- Privilege escalation attempts

## Future Test Enhancements

1. **Additional Fuzz Testing**: More property-based tests
2. **Integration Testing**: Real testnet integration
3. **Gas Optimization Tests**: Gas usage validation
4. **Upgrade Testing**: Contract upgrade scenarios
5. **Cross-chain Testing**: Multi-chain functionality
6. **Performance Testing**: High-load scenarios

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite provides robust coverage of the FlashLoanExecutor contract functionality, with a focus on security, edge cases, and property-based testing. While some tests need refinement, the current suite provides a solid foundation for ensuring contract reliability and security.
