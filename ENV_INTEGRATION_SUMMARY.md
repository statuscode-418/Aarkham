# Environment Variable Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `.env` file
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_AGENT_URL` for client-side Next.js access
- Added `HOST` and `PORT` for configurable FastAPI server settings
- Kept `AI_AGENT_URL` for backend reference

```properties
AI_AGENT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_AGENT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
HOST="0.0.0.0"
PORT="8000"
```

### 2. Updated Next.js Frontend (`app/home/page.tsx`)
- Fixed environment variable usage: `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_AGENT_URL`
- Fixed API endpoint construction: `${AI_AGENT_URL}/api/chat`
- Improved chat UI with proper user/AI message distinction
- Added loading indicators and disabled states
- Added Bot and User icons for better UX

### 3. Updated FastAPI Backend (`flash-loan-agent/app.py`)
- Made host and port configurable via environment variables
- Uses `HOST` and `PORT` from `.env` file with fallback defaults

### 4. Enhanced Chat UI Features
- Proper message typing with `"user" | "ai"`
- Loading spinner while AI is processing
- Disabled input and send button during loading
- Better visual distinction between user and AI messages
- Timestamps for messages

### 5. Created Test Script (`test_env_vars.py`)
- Verifies all environment variables are properly loaded
- Tests derived configuration values
- Validates frontend and backend integration

## How It Works

1. **Backend**: FastAPI server reads `HOST` and `PORT` from `.env` and runs on the configured address
2. **Frontend**: Next.js reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_AGENT_URL` and constructs API calls to `{URL}/api/chat`
3. **Environment**: All configuration is centralized in `.env` file

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI backend:
   ```bash
   cd flash-loan-agent
   python app.py
   ```

2. Start the Next.js frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. The chat UI will automatically connect to the AI agent using the URL from the environment variables.

## Key Benefits

- ✅ Centralized configuration in `.env`
- ✅ Proper client-side environment variable exposure
- ✅ Configurable server host/port
- ✅ Improved chat UI/UX
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Session persistence support
